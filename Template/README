Split the project into two streams-- one using a combination JLabel and MouseMotionListener, and another one using purely paintComponent for the gui as well as MouseMotionListener

Import techniques/things from GuiTest.java into the actual code.
Add each of the JLabels, setOpaque(false) for all of them. Make them all MouseListeners so that there is no need to configure mouse presses by pixel or coordinate.
Test adding icons to the JLabels and repainting to see fine results.
