All chess information is in Chess.java
The information about individual pieces is in 2D array of Squares, which extend JLabel.
The gui is in Board.java.
The squares are all opaque JLabels with background colors, and the squares are imageicons.

Import techniques/things from GuiTest.java into the actual code.
Add each of the JLabels, setOpaque(false) for all of them. Make them all MouseListeners so that there is no need to configure mouse presses by pixel or coordinate.
Test adding icons to the JLabels and repainting to see fine results.
